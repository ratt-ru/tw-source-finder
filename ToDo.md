General guide adapted from notes in [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-upload-your-first-python-package-to-pypi/)

* Improve Docs: polish README with subtitle and installation guide
~~* Add missing file for PyPI setup tools: Add CHANGELOG, setup.py/setup.cfg/pyproject.toml~~
~~* Improve package structure: use [recommended](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure) structure or work back from [ska-python-example](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/templates/ska-python-skeleton)~~
* Make a release
* Build and push the release to PyPi
